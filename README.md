# 2D RayTracing, Python demo feat. Pygame

The window is 1500x700 pixels (frameless), so i recomend you to have a 1080p screen to have the best experience,
but you can change it at the line 11 in 'pygame.display.set-mode((x, y), pygame.NOFRAME)'.

Blocks won't change:
you have to go to the blocks list, and modify all that data.

"Blocks" is a list made by lists, each of one represents a block.
On each block, you can put as many points as you want, but this points have to be writed as tuples.
(actually, i don't think so, but it is safer if you write tuples)

in line 26 in 'for x in range(y):' you can change the number of rays

toast(r1, r2) and touchpoint(r1, r2) are ecuations that i have copied from wikipedia
