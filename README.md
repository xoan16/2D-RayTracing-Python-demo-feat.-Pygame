# 2D RayTracing, Python demo feat. Pygame

the window is 1500x700 pixels (frameless), so i recomend you to have a 1080p screen to have the best experience,
but you can change it at the line  in 'pygame.display.set-mode((x, y), pygame.NOFRAME)'
blocks won't change:
you have to go to the blocks list, and modify all that data. 
blocks is a list made by lists, each of one represents a block
on each block, you can put as many points as you want, but this points have to be writed as tuples
(actually, i don't think so, but it is safer if you write tuples)

in line  in 'for x in range(y):' you can change the number of rays

toast(r1, r2) and touchpoint(r1, r2) are ecuations that i have copied from wikipedia
